| 26.06.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I discussed with Yuriy and Sergey a plan to combine all Harmony bots into one, worked out a common approach; [created](https://github.com/ArtemKolodko/HarmonyOneBot) project structure and basic methods of HarmonyOneBot. Working on wallet bot architecture that will include TOTP and key storage on user device (web apps localStorage).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 23.06.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I redeployed voice-memo bot with the new username: @OneVoiceAIBot. Created web3 library [test](https://github.com/ArtemKolodko/telegram-web-app-bot-example) for telegram web apps (works fine); it can be used in wallet bot. Start exploring the sources of all Harmony bots to combine it into one HarmonyOneAIBot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 22.06.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I tested telegram web apps localStorage ([sources](https://github.com/ArtemKolodko/telegram-web-app-bot-example)); started testing npm libraries in telegram web apps to use it in telegram wallet bot. Fixed issue with missing p.country and j.country erc1155 metadata in the Explorer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 21.06.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I continues work on the telegram wallet: researching 1wallet technical docs (https://github.com/polymorpher/one-wallet/wiki) and OTP, start testing data storage in telegram web [apps](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 20.06.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I started work on telegram [wallet](https://harmony.one/telegram-wallets): explored various approaches to create a non-custodial wallet with a telegram bot. The idea with secret [sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing) seemed interesting, created demo [script](https://github.com/ArtemKolodko/secret-sharing-demo/blob/master/src/index.ts) to test this approach. The main idea is that private key split into parts and distributed between multiple instances; a complete key is never stored in one place. Working on pros and cons of this idea, exploring another approaches. |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19.06.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I completed testing and released [voice-memo](https://t.me/HarmonyVoiceMemoBot) bot and payments service (https://github.com/harmony-one/stripe-payments-backend/commit/7f63c185344df0101674fb3657f620456d6a2ddb) with ONE token payment support. Each Telegram user using the bot is assigned an address in the Harmony network, which will be used to pay for the bot's actions. In the next updates we may add ONE token payment to all bots that use the paid API.                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 16.06.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I completed the first version of voice-memo bot with ONE tokens payments: [added](https://github.com/ArtemKolodko/voice-memo-bot/pull/4/files) payment estimate, user balance check and /pay [method](https://github.com/ArtemKolodko/stripe-payments-backend/commit/81b092c425b3d7610d60dbba403de6fe60e23d99) on payments service side. Started testing; voice-memo (https://t.me/HarmonyVoiceMemoBot) bot with ONE payments will be released on Monday (June 19).                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 15.06.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I continues to work on ONE payment in telegram bots: [added](https://github.com/ArtemKolodko/voice-memo-bot/commit/8d6438189f0d0e323b0b18067e4b7b9e9c5e4392) balance check when sending a request to the voice-memo bot; added creation of a blockchain address for the new bot user. Working on the last two features: estimating the amount of ONE to pay and withdrawing from the user's balance before the bot task is started.                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 14.06.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I  [fixed](https://github.com/harmony-one/explorer-v2-backend/pull/109) bug in ERC721 contracts indexer. ONE token payments: completed the main part on the payments service side, started integrating the voice-memo (https://t.me/HarmonyVoiceMemoBot) bot with it (check telegram user balance, estimate payment amount).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
