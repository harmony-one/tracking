Integrated (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/49/files) paid features with QR code and SD bot modules, and updated the @HarmonyOneAIBot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 27.07.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I added (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/46/commits/3c12db0f15c622881638d636501f0d0c6ab8b073) the 24-hour bridged assets metric to the harmony bot using new bridge API endpoint for operations history (thanks to Yuriy). Started e2e testing, the bot will be updated on Friday with all 3 metrics (24-h Harmony network fees, bot fees and bridged assets).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Yuriy is helping with bridge API to fetch the bridged assets metrics for the last week (now the data is available only for the last 24 hours).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 13.07.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I reviewed HarmonyOneBot PR (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/16) from Sergey and deployed an update. Added fallback audio summarization by Speechmatics  (it's marked as [Speechmatics] at the end of text) because sometimes Kagi (https://kagi.com/summarizer/index.html) API  started to return error 500. Worked on the implementation of the @HarmonyOneAIBot paid features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12.07.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I finalized the draft architecture for the paid @HarmonyOneAIBot features, you can check and review it here (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot#bot-paid-features). Removed Medium link from the Explorer, added link (https://substack.com/@harmonyone) to the Substack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11.07.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I helped Soph to update testnet Explorer (https://explorer.testnet.harmony.one/) client to the latest version. Added telegram bots and AI API monthly costs to the bot details notion page (https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Machine-Details-for-AI-Bots-and-Domains-ea245dfe230f42a390322ff506c18ef7). Described the telegram wallet architecture to review by Stephen and Aaron (this info will be added to the HarmonyOneBot repository (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot) readme later). Working on a  architecture for @HarmonyOneAIBot paid features.                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 10.07.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I improved telegram wallet UX and UI (https://github.com/ArtemKolodko/telegram-wallet-web-app/commits/master) components: TOTP code will be requested only if the user performs some action with the account (export private key, sign a transaction); completed testing and deployed @HarmonyOneAIBot update with the wallet support. Text /wallet in private chat with bot to open the web app. Start working on the payments for the bot requests with telegram wallet support.                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 07.07.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I worked on the telegram wallet: added sign transfer transactions page. This feature will allow user to send transfer request to the bot via message and sign it in telegram web app popup. Start testing, will deploy wallet update on Monday. Turned off image-gen bot until the images request fix. Reviewed (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/11) QR bot PR from Sergey, updated @HarmonyOneAIBot.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 06.07.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I worked on telegram wallet support in @HarmonyOneAIBot: added (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/commit/35e81a224f63170bd13f9afaf2bfc016ae5533cf) basic logic from the separate wallet bot, tested it with other bot commands. Working on a sign page in telegram web app that will allow the user to confirm and sign a transaction based on params from telegram user input.

| 05.07.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I completed (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/12) merging voice-memo with @HarmonyOneAIBot, deployed an update. Common bot now supports voice-memo features,  but the menu needs to be improved in future updates. Added Speechmatics  summarization support in the code (not in production yet), start testing it to compare with Kagi summarization which is currently used in the bot. Started working on @HarmonyOneAIBot payments using our telegram wallet (https://t.me/OneWalletDevBot).                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 04.07.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Today I added (https://github.com/ArtemKolodko/voice-memo-bot/pull/4) payment whitelist to voice-memo (https://t.me/OneVoiceAIBot) bot.

Tested Speechmatics summarization API (https://docs.speechmatics.com/features-other/summarization) with different params: it works well and allows you to make a summary in a single request along with a audio transcription. It can replace Kagi API in voice-memo (https://t.me/HarmonyVoiceMemoBot) after migration from separate bot to HarmonyOneAIBot. |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
