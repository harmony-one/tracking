| 29.09.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Improved one bot how wallets query to last updated wallet addresses. Continue testing image recognition with Alibaba's qwen chat (https://modelscope.cn/studios/qwen/Qwen-VL-Chat-Demo/summary).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 28.09.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Discussed invoices refactoring with Sergey to support both fiat and ONE invoices. Updated invoices database table (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/319) to support ONE amounts with all 18 decimal places (invoices (https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/blob/master/src/database/entities/Invoice.ts) were originally designed for fiat payments only), enabled invoices in hot wallet transfers; refactored payments module. Started testing payments update.                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 27.09.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Fixed bug with invoice and finally deployed ONE Payments v2 (https://www.notion.so/harmonyone/Payment-Architecture-4dc37df87bcb43d88febf63ff1b82a4c) on test and production bots. In the bot daily report you can see that bot started collecting fees from user's hot wallets (already collected 15K ONE). Unfortunately, after deploying webcrawler with Twitter user credential support discovered that Twitter has user location checks that are very difficult to bypass (the user has to enter a code from the email).                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26.09.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Worked on webcrawler: added (https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-webcrawler/commit/25a25ed73b8a62a89a93640e66ca12b32f3cfc42) twitter signIn with user credentials (username, password), tested Twitter homefeed parsing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 25.09.23 | 10:00      | 16:00    | 6            | Worked on webcrawler: added images filter that reduce network traffic and speedup loading time by 20% for regular web pages (tested on harmony.one, notion). Made final updates of ONE payments v2, resolved conflicts with master branch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
